# 🧠 INSANE-PROJECTS

Welcome to **INSANE-PROJECTS** – a repository where logic meets madness.

This is not just a collection of complex, high-effort builds — it’s a **journey into the core of systems**, where the goal is to **recreate the wheel** to understand how it turns.

Every project here is a deep dive, built from the ground up — **no shortcuts, no libraries doing the heavy lifting** — just raw logic and core fundamentals.

---

## 🔍 Philosophy

> **“Reinvent the wheel — not because it hasn’t been done before, but to understand how it *actually* rolls.”**

In an era of abstraction and convenience, this repo is a **return to the roots**:

* Build everything yourself
* Understand every layer
* Explore insane depths of logic and structure

## 🚀 Projects

### ♟️ Chess-engine

An AI-powered chess engine written from scratch.
This project is a classic “reinvent-the-wheel” attempt to understand the **inner workings of a real game engine**.

#### What It Covers:

* Move generation and validation
* Search algorithms (Minimax + Alpha-Beta pruning)
* Evaluation heuristics
* Game loop, board state, and undo/redo logic
* FEN parsing and future GUI/bitboard upgrades

> **Status:** 🟢 In Development
> **Goal:** Learn by building every piece of the logic manually
> **Language:** Python/C++ (flexible)
